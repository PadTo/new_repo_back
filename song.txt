overshadowed by lush arches
Couldn't catch the eye of no city girl

Here I am devoted to Ron
How I love the way you look in your violet jeans
Can't believe I let the smog cloud my eye

Where the lush arches stand
And the lush waters surround
I'll ride my grey truck with you by my side

There's a whisper in the Oxfordshire breeze
Reminding me of Maddie
That whisper builds
That whisper cries
Maddie in the morning skies

You appear on the horizon
Brushing that silver hair from your eyes

The city folk with their fancy gadgets
Cement arches like grey tombs
Don't have nothin' on our way of life
Just listen to the cuckoos

Don't live your life like a scoundrel
Today might feel a time to be like a scoundrel
But that ain't no way to lead a life
