overshadowed by lush arches
Couldn't catch the eye of no city girl

Here I am devoted to Ron
How I love the way you look in your violet jeans
Can't believe I let the smog cloud my eye

Where the lush arches stand
And the lush waters surround
I'll ride my grey truck with you by my side

There's a whisper in the Oxfordshire breeze
Reminding me of Maddie
That whisper builds
That whisper cries
Maddie in the morning skies
